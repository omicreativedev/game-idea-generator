# Game Idea Generator

A simple web application that generates random game ideas by combining adjectives and character types.

## Features

- Generates random game ideas with the format: "A game about a(n) [adjective] [character] and a(n) [adjective] [character] with friends of [adjective] [character] and enemies of [adjective] [character] and a final boss of [adjective] [character]"
- Click on any adjective or character to freeze/unfreeze it
- Frozen terms remain unchanged when generating new ideas
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
